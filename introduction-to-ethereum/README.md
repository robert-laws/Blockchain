## Introduction to Ethereum

Similar to bitcoin, ethereum allows for use of the blockchain to conduct transactions and transparently transfer and store value. Ethereum introduces automation including smart contracts. This helps to make use of blockchain technologies more accessible and easier to use.

In financial services, ethereum differs from fiat currency in that it is a cryptocurrency, it does not have the backing of a government, and its value is based on consensus.

## Impact on Modern Life

- Financial Services
  - improves security and overhead for financial transactions
- Digital Identity Management
  - helps to offer a unique identifier for people and devices
  - helps to facilitate identification process

Ethereum digital identity management produces an account

- unique pair of keys (public and private)
- ERC-725 - allows association of ethereum with real-world identity
- claim of identity can be verified against an account (identity exists on the blockchain)

## Smart Contracts

Set of rules that must be followed to properly register a transaction on the blockchain. It's a program that can only run on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The EVM executes the bytecode that enforces the rules for the blockchain transaction.

To become a node on the Ethereum blockchain, the steps include first to download and run the EVN, which provides access to the blockchain. Every node runs the same smart contract and the output of the code is the same on every node, which maintains integrity of the blockchain.

Ethereum has it's own cryptocurrency Ether (ETH). It can be bought via an exchange. It can be sold and traded. To make these transactions, there first must be an exchange account. Creating an Ethereum address is the process of creating a public and private key. The public key provides account details and the private key is used to sign transactions. A Wallet is used to store private keys used to access cryptoassets.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) is a business with minimal human interaction and decisions are made based on smart contract code. An example is use of an autonomous vehicle that can be used for transportation and the financial transactions are handled by the smart contracts.

## Ethereum Ecosystem

- Blockchain - is the data including transactions and smart contract code
- EVM - the virtual machine that executes the smart contract code
- Address
- Private Key via a Wallet to store private keys
- Exchange account
- Development environment
- Test environment
- Client interface

### Blockchain Client

Need an EVM and blockchain code to test before deployment. Test blockchain (ex. Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby). Then deploy to mainnet. Code must be compiled and tested on a framework to take bytecode, push it to a test network, and invoke functions.
